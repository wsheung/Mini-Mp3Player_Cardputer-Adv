# Mini MP3 Player for Cardputer Adv

This is fork from  AleksM2137's repository: https://github.com/AleksM2137/Mini-Mp3Player_Cardputer-Adv

SD-Card is required

## Changes:
- Smaller volume and brightness steps (Even the lowest volume setting was killing my ears)
- Using https://github.com/wsheung/ESP32-audioI2S fork to build (pulled upstream changes contributed by https://github.com/schreibfaul1/ESP32-audioI2S/discussions/450) so we can support more volume steps.
